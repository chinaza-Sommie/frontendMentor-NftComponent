**Working on this project made me better understand HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

My users are able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

Want some support on the challenge? [Join our Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack) and ask questions in the **#help** channel.

## Where to find everything

I made use of the information in the stylesGuide file to work on styles for the page.
